I have joined Bloomberg as a new graduate software engineer in 2022. 

I have studied from 2017-2022 at the [University of Edinburgh](https://ed.ac.uk) where I graduated from my integrated masters in Electronics and Computer Science (MEng Hons) top of my class with a high first class classification.

Following the work I've done on my master's thesis regarding the exploration of how Sparse Gaussian Processes and Deep Neural Networks can be applied to Online Inverse dynamics learning, I have published a [conference paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04796) to the [IROS 2022](https://iros2022.org/) under the supervision and [Gabriella Pizzuto](https://gabriellapizzuto.github.io/) and [Michael Mistry](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mmistry/).
